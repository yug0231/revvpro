                                This depends on the pricing plan that you select. If you go for the “Unlimited kms”
                                pricing plans (available only without fuel, and only for bookings whose duration is more
                                than 24 hours), there is absolutely no limit to the kilometres that you can drive, and
                                you have complete flexibility of driving the car as much as you want. Revv it up! Other
                                pricing plans have a "Kilometres limit", which varies based on the plan selected. You
                                can still drive beyond the kilometres limit, but the additional kilometres clocked will
                                attract an additional charge.

                                All of our cars are equipped with an All India Tourist Permit, so you are free to drive
                                anywhere in the country. All India Tourist Permit means that the car is legally
                                permitted to ply in any state in the country, after paying the inter-state taxes at the
                                state borders. However, we do not permit taking Revv vehicles to Leh/Ladakh region,
                                Kaza/Nako region and spiti valley. We also advise you to avoid bad terrains (especially
                                in non- SUV cars) and areas affected by civil unrest.

                                Please note: Interstate taxes at the state borders are to be paid and borne by the
                                customer. Our cars are equipped with Fast tag devices for your convenience. The toll
                                charges incurred during your trip will be billed to you in your invoice.

                                needs to be availed while creating of the booking, before it is confirmed. You may also

                                In the event of damages, your liability is limited to a maximum of Rs 10000. You will
                                need to pay Damage Fee equivalent to the repair cost (as estimated by an authorized
                                dealership) and downtime losses, upto a maximum of Rs 10000. This is independent of the
                                nature and terms of the insurance cover that Revv has on the cars.

                                Please note that the maximum liability policy is intended to benefit and protect the
                                responsible user. In situations of irresponsible or unsafe or negligent usage, there
                                could be discretionary exceptions to this policy, whereby the user could be liable for
                                all damages irrespective of whether or not Revv is able to claim insurance in such
                                cases. Examples of such situation include, but are not limited to:

                                When the User is not in compliance with the laws and/or with terms of the Revv User
                                Agreement
                                When the User is found to be under the influence of alcohol/narcotics while driving
                                When the User is over-speeding (i.e. above prescribed speed limit of road or 125 Kms/Hr,
                                whichever is lower)
                                When the User is in violation of traffic rules or of the Motor Vehicles Act (for
                                example, if the User has not paid the inter-state tax while crossing a state border)
                                When the person driving the vehicle at the time of the incident is found to be different
                                than the one who made the booking
                                When the vehicle workshop and/or insurance company deem the damage to be consequential
                                in nature (this will be clearly stated in the accident report). Consequential damage
                                occurs when the User continues driving the vehicle even when it is performing abnormally
                                When the number of people in the car at the time of the incident exceed the standard
                                seating capacity of the car
                                When the incident happened in a state for which the user had failed to pay the
                                inter-state tax while entering the state
                                When there is misrepresentation of information in the driving license and ID proof
                                details shared by the user
                                Where there is clear evidence of extremely rash and negligent driving on the user's part
                                In cases where the estimated damage charges exceed the security deposit, we will request
                                the user to pay the same at the time of returning the car. In cases of non-payment, Revv
                                reserves the right of legal action, reporting to credit bureau and reporting to other
                                authorities or persons, irrespective of their direct relevance to the case.

                                Revv typically avoids charging for very minor damages (e.g., minor scratches and dents),
                                and covers the vast majority of damage incidents under the maximum liability policy.

                                In cases of collision or User failure, towing and impounding charges will be paid by the
                                User. In cases of vehicle failure, towing and impounding charges will be paid by us.

                                125 Kms/Hr is the speed limit. Exceeding it will attract a penalty for over-speeding. In
                                some states (e.g., Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR), some cars might be equipped with
                                speed governors, which will automatically restrict the speed to 80Kms/Hr. This is as per
                                government directives.

                                Each State has different procedures and regulations. Most States will require a
                                commercially registered vehicle to stop at the border RTO station to pay the relevant
                                tolls/taxes. All Revv cars are equipped with original copies of the RC Card, Insurance
                                Note, Self-Drive License, and the All India Permit, which will help you get through this
                                conveniently. For many states, the state entry tax can be paid online as well.
